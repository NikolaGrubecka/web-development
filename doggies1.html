<img class="image-border" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Aidi.jpg" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>The Aidi</strong></em> is a Berber dog breed used as a livestock guardian, protecting herds of sheep and goats. 
It also possesses hunting capabilities and good scenting ability. 
In its native North Africa, it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has located by scent.</p>

<img class="image-border" src="https://a.allegroimg.com/s1024/0c3d25/b050f0a44590aedc04bbb7bbc257" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>The Akita</strong></em> is a large breed of dog originating from the mountainous regions of northern Japan.
There are two separate varieties of Akita: a Japanese strain, commonly called Akita Inu (inu means dog in Japanese) or Japanese Akita, and an American strain, known as the Akita or American Akita.
The Japanese strain comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain comes in all dog colors.
The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the German Shepherd or Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can also be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.
The Akita is a powerful, independent and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family members.
As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.</p>

<p><em><strong>The beagle</strong></em> is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound.
The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling).
Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as detection dogs for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world.
The beagle is intelligent. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Lacy Dog</strong></em> or <em><strong>Blue Lacy Dog</strong></em> is a breed of working dog that originated in Texas in the mid-19th century.
The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate.
In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as "a true Texas breed".
In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as "the official State Dog Breed of Texas".
As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas.
However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Canaan Dog</strong></em>, also known as <em><strong>the Bedouin Sheepdog</strong></em> and <em><strong>Palestinian Pariah Dog</strong></em>, is a breed of pariah dog, which has been in existence in the Middle East for thousands of years.
There are 2,000 to 3,000 Canaan dogs across the world, mostly in Europe and North America.</p>

<h1><i>The Canadian Eskimo Dog</i></h1>
<div class="flex-item">
<img class="image-border" src="https://www.ckc.ca/getattachment/19404f9c-c0aa-4989-a516-69eff3090338/BevTaylor2015a2.jpg.aspx?width=350&height=351" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>The Canadian Eskimo Dog</strong></em> is an Arctic breed of working dog. Other names include qimmiq or qimmit (Inuit language word for "dog").
The Greenland Dog is genetically identical.
The breed is currently threatened with extinction, with a 2008 estimate of only 300 purebred dogs.
Although once used as the preferred method of transportation by Inuit in the Canadian Arctic, by the 1960s traditional working dog teams became increasingly rare in the North.
Contributing factors to the breed's decline include the increasing popularity of snowmobiles for transportation and the spread of infectious canine diseases.
Controversy surrounds the intentional killings of a debated number of Inuit sled dogs between 1950 and 1970 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as recent efforts to increase the breed's population.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Chow-Chow</strong></em> is a dog breed originally from northern China, where it is referred to as Songshi-Quan, which means "puffy-lion dog".
The Chow-Chow has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century.
One writer has proposed that the Chow-Chow originated in China 2,000 years ago or originated in Arctic Asia 3,000 years ago and then migrated to Mongolia, Siberia and then to China.[1]:11
One Chinese legend mentions large war dogs from Central Asia that resembled black-tongued lions. One Chinese ruler was said to own 5,000 Chows.
The Chinese also used Chows to pull dog-sleds, and this was remarked upon by Marco Polo.[1]:11 One author states that the Chow-Chow was also bred for human consumption.
Today, the AKC registers approximately 10,000 Chow-Chows a year. The Canadian Kennel Club registers approximately 350.</p>

<h1><i>The Eurasier</i></h1>
<div class="flex-item">
<img class="image-border" src="https://thehappypuppysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eurasier-HP-long.jpg" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>The Eurasier</strong></em>, or <em><strong>Eurasian dog</strong></em>, is a breed of dog of the spitz type that originated in Germany.
It is widely known as a wonderful companion that maintains its own personality, has a dignified reserve to strangers, a strong bond to its family and that is relatively easy to train.
The Eurasier is a balanced, well-constructed, medium-sized Spitz (Spitzen) type dog with prick ears.
It comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan.
All color combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color.
Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs.
The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair.
The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.</p>

<h1><i>The Finnish Spitz</i></h1>
<div class="flex-item">
<img class="image-border" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/82/a3/9282a3627922211a112ddab596740862.jpg" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>A Finnish Spitz</strong></em> is a breed of dog originating in Finland.
The breed was originally bred to hunt all types of game from squirrels and other rodents to bears.
It is a "bark pointer", indicating the position of game by barking, and drawing the game animal's attention to itself, allowing an easier approach for the hunter.
Its original game hunting purpose was to point to game that fled into trees, such as grouse, and capercaillies, but it also serves well for hunting elk.
Some individuals have even been known to go after a bear.
In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog.
The breed is friendly and in general loves children, so it is suitable for domestic life.
The Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979.</p>

<h1><i>The Greenland Dog</i></h1>
<div class="flex-item">
<img class="image-border" src="https://deltamascota.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/alaskan-malamute3.jpg" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>Greenland Dog</strong></em> is a large breed of husky-type dog kept as a sled dog.
They were brought from Siberia to North America by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, along with the Canadian Eskimo Dog that is genetically identical.
Today the breed is considered as nationally and culturally important to Greenland and efforts are made to safeguard its purity.
In western Greenland north of the Arctic Circle and entire eastern Greenland, it is illegal to import any dog from outside (except for police and assistance dogs with a special permit), and since 2017 all dogs have to be microchipped and registered in the Greenland dog database.
In the southwest, such restrictions are not in place and the purity of dogs is not monitored.
As the population has been falling (c. 15,000 in Greenland as of 2016), a number of projects have been initiated in an attempt of ensuring that Greenland's dog sledding culture, knowledge and use, along with the breed itself, are not lost.</p>

<h1><i>The Pandikona</i></h1>
<div class="flex-item">
<img class="image-border" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5e/a2/13/5ea2133dc7f0a536a037c92a137bee99.jpg" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
<p><em><strong>The Pandikona</strong></em> is a primitive-type hunting dog from Pattikonda taluk-Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh India.
"Pandikona" is a medium size sight hound which is adapted to harsh climatic conditions of Kurnool district.
This breed is associated with shepherd families of that region. PandiKona dogs need very little care.
The Indian Pandikona is one of the forgotten breeds from Andra Pradesh.
The Pandikona is named after the location where it is found. Pandikona is located near Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh.
The area is considered dangerous to outsiders because of warring factions and political differences.
This highly territorial breed is used to guard villages, property and livestock and to hunt any available game.
Their territorial nature and sharp tempers often result in fights with neighboring dogs that trespass onto its territory.
Since Pandikona is a small village with overlapping property boundaries and most homes has 2 to 3 dogs, it is quite natural for dogs to posture and get into occasional squabbles over borders.</p>
